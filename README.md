# Movie-Recommendation-based-on-Emotion-using-Python
One of the underlying targets of movies is to evoke emotions in their viewers. IMDb offers all the movies for all genre. Therefore the movie titles can be scraped from the IMDb list to recommend to the user.IMDb does not have an API, for accessing information on movies and TV Series. Therefore we have to perform scraping. Scraping is used for accessing information from a website which is usually done with APIs.
The correspondence of every emotion with genre of movies is listed below:  Sad – Drama Disgust – Musical Anger – Family Anticipation – Thriller Fear – Sport Enjoyment – Thriller Trust – Western Surprise – Film-Noir.
Based on the input emotion, the corresponding genre would be selected and all the top 5 movies of that genre would be recommended to the user.

Web Scraping is highly beneficial in extracting the data and doing analysis on it. Without web scraping, the Internet as you know it really wouldn’t exist. That’s because Google and other major search engines rely upon a sophisticated web scraper to pull the content that will get included in their index. These tools are what makes search engines possible.

Applications of Crawling:
Article extraction for websites that curate content.
Business listings extraction for companies that build databases of leads.
Many different types of data extraction, sometimes called data mining. For example, one popular and sometimes controversial use of a web scraper is for pulling prices off of airlines to publish on airfare comparison sites.
